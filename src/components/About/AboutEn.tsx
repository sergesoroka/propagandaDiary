          of &quot;Propaganda Diar&ldquo; included the media of these countries
          because, on the eve of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,
          Germany and Italy were among the main targets of Kremlin propaganda in
          Europe.
        </span>
        After February 2022, Kremlin disinformation campaigns in the European
        information space reached unprecedented levels. As expected, pro-Russian
        actors began to discredit the Ukrainian political leadership and the
        army, including false accusations of war crimes. They also attempted to
        deny Russian atrocities and deliberate killings of civilians. They
        directed efforts towards undermining trust in Ukraine as a partner and
        recipient of military and financial aid necessary to fend off Russian
        aggression. For European citizens, they attempted to create a clear
        image of a corrupt and incompetent state that their governments should
        not allocate resources to. Meanwhile, pro-Kremlin media began inciting
        hostility towards Ukrainian refugees who were forced to flee the war.
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        In this context, there was a need to create resilience to informational
        manipulation among societies targeted by Russian propaganda. The first
        step towards this is systematic monitoring of key disinformation
        narratives in each individual country. Therefore, VoxCheck expanded the
        &quot;Propaganda Diar&ldquo; database to monitor six countries: Germany,
        Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.

      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        To detect cases of disinformation, VoxCheck uses weekly manual
        monitoring of a selected list of online resources. The new version of
        the &quot;Propaganda Diar&ldquo; database covers the period from
        February 2022, and during further monitoring, it will be updated with
        new cases of disinformation. Every month, we publish trend{" "}

        White and black lists of resources{" "}
      </h2>

      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        First, to form the database on disinformation it was necessary to
        identify key media outlets in relevant countries and distinguish
        credible sources from questionable ones. Thus, we created white and
        black lists of media in each of the six countries.
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        Media on the white list are high-quality media providing reliable
        information about Ukraine&rsquo;s foreign and domestic policies. On the
        contrary, sources on the black list spread fake news about Ukraine on a
        regular basis.
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          To differentiate sources and create these lists we used the following
          criteria:
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        ● Professional standards. The high-quality media on the white list must
        meet the standards: comprehensiveness and impartiality of news coverage;
        objectivity and emotional neutrality; balance of opinions; transparency
        and reliability of information sources; separation of facts and
        comments. Our monitoring has shown that media on the black list
        constantly neglect these standards.
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          ● Ownership and transparency. Media must publicly disclose their
          ownership, funding and potential conflicts of interest. For example,
          some mass media are directly connected to Russian state news agencies.
          And therefore, most likely, they will spread disinformation about
          Ukraine.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          ● Media monitoring results from Media Bias/Fact Check. We selected
          some resources according to the Media Bias/Fact Check rating, a web
          platform that generates ratings on bias, factual accuracy, and
          credibility of sources based on assessments by independent
          fact-checkers. According to Media Bias/Fact Check, blacklisted
          resources have a very low level of factual reporting. Instead,
          whitelisted resources are rated as the least biased and have a high
          level of factual presentation.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          ● EUvsDisinfo monitoring results. We used the EUvsDisinfo databases on
          different countries. EUvsDisinfo is a project of the European External
          Action Service&#34;s East StratCom Task Force. It was created
          specifically to monitor and counter Russian disinformation campaigns
          in Europe.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          ● Results of own monitoring. When choosing resources for monitoring,
          we focused on the reliability of reports about Ukraine. Sources that
          previously systematically disseminated Russian disinformation were
          added to the blacklist.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          ● Consultations with local fact-checkers and journalists. We also
          asked for advice from colleagues working in Germany, Italy, Poland,
          the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. Representatives of various
          organizations advised to pay attention to some mass media that used to
          spread fake news. We also analyzed cases of fakes, recorded by local
          fact-checkers who signed the IFCN Code of Ethics.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          It is often impossible to confirm the motives of the authors whose
          materials have been monitored by us. So we do not claim that each of
          the mentioned sources spread Russian disinformation purposefully, and
          not as a result of unconscious mistakes. However, their messages were
          consonant with the key narratives of Kremlin propaganda about Ukraine.

        <span>
          The database consists of thousands of blatantly fake or manipulative
          messages, which we call{" "}

        <span>
          <strong>disinformation cases</strong>
        </span>
        <span>

          common theme into{" "}

        <span>
          <strong>fakes</strong>
        </span>

          <strong>narratives</strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          based on a key common message. That is, different cases of
          disinformation are examples of the same fake. And various fakes are
          examples of one disinformation narrative.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <span>
          As part of the monitoring, we managed to single out more than 320
          fakes and 27 disinformation narratives. The number of disinformation
          cases will be constantly updated as VoxCheck continues to monitor
          selected resources.
